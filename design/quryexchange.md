## queryexchange

Oringally designed and *pitched* in 2019-07, deleted because of doubt, the core idea recollected

- app so users can query data, post queries and share links, rate posts and discuss queries
- like reddit, but for queries

## features

- the: 
- an app like `stackoverflow`, `reddit`
- like stackexchange has queries https://data.stackexchange.com/stackoverflow/query/new 
- but use grapqhl, somehting like graphiql https://lucasconstantino.github.io/graphiql-online/
- users can query data using query language and discuss it
- the topic is the query, then users leave comments and can link to others
- also, posts (queries) can be ranked up/down like on reddit

## user experience

- everyone in the organization can make queries, share links and discuss
- people can use query lanugauge, not ust limited ui, so everyone is more involved and elevated - people have access to data
- using a query language unlimits user potential to find answers by contructing rich queries - no ui can provide what language provides
- example
  - sports, people constantly need interesting facts per- and post- game, like "this will be the 250 match of player X, where they've scored 10+ points in the first quarter"
  - such details are the foundation of television discussions and media articles, enriching the narrative with fascinating facts
- unfirtunately, only few people have access to data, and it's not a pulbic sharable link, what limits the possiblities of coming up with more exciting queries and disucssions
- instead, make it an app like reddit  with postable, sharable and rankable queries - and everyone will be involved


## note from 2020

- this alredy exists in some forms, but not on reddit level
